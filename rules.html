<h1>Rules</h1>
<p>The dealer (the computer) deals two cards face up. You have an option to bet, or not to bet, depending on whether or not you feel the next card dealt will have a value between the first two.
    Your initial money is set to $100. The game is over if you lose all your money. If you reach $1,000 in cash you win.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you bet and the middle card rank value is <strong>in between</strong>, you win back <strong>double your bet</strong>.</li>
    <li>If you bet and the middle card rank value is <strong>outside the range</strong>, you <strong>lose what you bet</strong>.</li>
    <li>If you bet and the middle card rank value is <strong>equal to any of the two cards</strong>, you <strong>lose double your bet</strong>.</li>
</ul>
