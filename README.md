# Acey Ducey

Just taking a stab at coding up little games based on the [Basic Computer Games](https://github.com/coding-horror/basic-computer-games) book which is currently a project that has been open source by Jeff Atwood([Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/about-me/)).

Started with [Acey Ducey ](https://github.com/coding-horror/basic-computer-games/tree/main/01_Acey_Ducey)
